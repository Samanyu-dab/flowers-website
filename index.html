             <h2>   Balloon Flower  </h2>
                <br>
 <p6>
The Balloon Flower also goes by the name Platycodon or the Chinese bellflower. This plant is an herb and perennial with a short flowering period.

The flowers are typically a shade of blue or white or pale pink. These spread slowly and tend to be compact, so youâ€™ll want to mark their position to avoid removing them as a weed.

The Lewesia plant is native to America. The plant grows best in rocky environments or on well-drained slopes, and the plants are typically low growing.

The flowers are bright and funnel shaped, with most blossoms a pink or magenta color. These plants are known for hybridizing readily, which can produce interesting variations.
